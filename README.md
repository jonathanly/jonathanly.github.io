## Project 1 - Portfolio Site

# Design Documentation
## Aim

My primary focus was to create a fun yet minimalistic portfolio design. The portfolio is a one-pager, I have always loved the style and how modular it can be when it comes to editing it in the future. The language choice used is very casual. Why? My social media presence isn't very strong yet hence why this portfolio is geared towards highlighting a bit of my personality to prospectiver employers. 

Due to time constraints, I have decided to go with a bootstrap template. If time had permitted, I would've liked to make a website from scratch to really drill in HTML & CSS concepts. However, this decision had its own set of hurdles to jump through.
