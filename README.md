## Project 1 - Portfolio Site
Proudly hosted at jonathanly.github.io (yay first live webpage!)

# Design Documentation
## Aim

My primary focus was to create a fun yet minimalistic portfolio design. The portfolio is a one-pager, I have always loved the style and how modular it can be when it comes to editing it in the future. The language choice used is very casual. Why? My social media presence isn't very strong yet hence why this portfolio is geared towards highlighting a bit of my personality to prospectiver employers. 

Due to time constraints, I have decided to go with a bootstrap template. If time had permitted, I would've liked to make a website from scratch to really drill in HTML & CSS concepts. However, this decision had its own set of hurdles to jump through.

## One-Pager Elements
# About Me (Hi There!)

Very short informal introduction about myself and my current life goals. Will be endeavouring to add more information about myself in the future

# Countdown Timer

This section highlights my number one goal at the moment, graduating from Coderfactory Academy! I purposely left out a title to invoke viewer curiousity to read on and find out what it was all about

# Skills (What's that)

Flowing on from the timer countdown's purpose, I quickly summerised the skills expected of me when I graduate from Coderfactory Academy. Instead of displaying it in list form, I used developer icon database, Devicons.fr, and purposely selected colourful icons to grab attention. Icon colour scheme also matches my website colour theme. A very positive outcome from a somewhat unintentional decision.

# Projects

Will be showcasing some of the projects I've completed thus far. Section is still in the works due to time constraints.
The plan is to include thumbnails, a short desciption and links to about 4-6 of my best works to date. These works will be hosted on GitHub where the code can be viewed.
